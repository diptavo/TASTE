## 1. Overview
In this paper we introduce TASTE (Trans Association using Shared factorization and
TEsting), a summary statistic-based framework to identify protein sets that are trans-
regulated by genetic variants associated with sets of biologically related cancers.
TASTE consists of three steps: (1) TASTE-D, a low-rank matrix factorization to estimate
shared and group-specific trans-association patterns across cancers; (2) TASTE-S, a
sparse singular value decomposition to identify proteins driving shared effects; (3)
TASTE-T, a competitive testing strategy for evaluating significance of trans-associations
captured by the identified protein-set.
